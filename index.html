<h1>Basic Intro. of HTML and WWW
</h1>  
<h2> How does World Wide Web work</h2>

<p> The World Wide Web (www) is an information system of interlinked hypertext documents that are accessed via the Internet. It has also commonly become known simply as the Web.</p>

<h2> What is HTML</h2>
<p> HTML stands for <b>Hypertext Markup Language</b>, and it is how the content on the web is displayed on web browsers, such as, Google Chrome, Safari...In short, HTML provides a framework for webpages. 

</p>

<h2> Components of HTML</h2>
<p> <b>Elements:</b> All HTML documents are made of HTML elements and each element is enclosed in angle brackets or Tags (< >). <br>

</p>
<p> <b> Tag:</b> An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets (< >). Though most tags have an opening and closing tag, some tages -<em> Void Tags - </em>do not require a closing tag. </p>
<p> <b> Attribute: </b> An Attribute is a property of an HTML element. For instance, to add a link (Google) to words "I'm feeling lucky", we set <em>href</em> attribute of an anchor tag in this way. <br> 
<a href = "www.google.com"> I'm feeling lucky</a>. 
<br> 

</p>
<p> We were also introduced concepts suchs as servers, browsers, HTTP, internet, and more importantly, how it all works in sync.  </p>
